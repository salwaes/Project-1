## Synonymory

##### A game of words and synonyms ruled by limited time.

#### User Player :

As a player, I want to be shown one word so that I'll memorize it and write its synonym back.

As a player, I need to see the word for a short time and the time remaining before the given word fades away.

As a player, I want different possible right answers to be accepted.
  If I choose a closest synonym I'll get higher score.
  If my answer is right I go to the next level.
  If my answer is wrong I'll have a chance to try again
  If I lose for the second time, I'll get the message "game over".

As a player, I need to have more words in the next level to increase the difficulty.

As a player, I want to see my current level and score during the game.

As a player, I can replay the game at any time.
